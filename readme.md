## Examples

### For now, the api documentation is not avalable yet, but these are some of the example request/response from the api.

### If you want to test/use the endpoint without deploying the code yourself, you can use [this demo already deployed to aws lambda](https://cvlfhq42xly43elddwo263eley0rslco.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/).<br><br>For these examples, we are gonna use [Duel Links Grand Prix #1](https://www.start.gg/tournament/duel-links-grand-prix-1-1/) as start.gg example, [G1X #150](https://tonamel.com/competition/boZzF) as tonamel example, ~~and [Latam Showdown Rush Duel #1](https://paidiagaming.com/tournament/latam-showdown-rush-duel-1-6515a9756ed9b6ad202c45f7) as paidiagaming example~~.
